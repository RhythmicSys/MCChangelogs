# CHANGELOGS FROM MINECRAFT
These changelogs are directly taken from the [Minecraft Website](https://www.minecraft.net/) when a release comes out.
This repository was made with the express purpose of having an easier way to navigate the changelogs, and easier access (such as being able to link to specific lines of the changelog)

NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG OR MICROSOFT
