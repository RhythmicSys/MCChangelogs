Take your ingenious Redstone designs to new heights with the Crafter, play around with the Wind Charge, discover new decorative blocks made of Copper and Tuff, enjoy new Paintings, Music Discs, and more!

And that's not all! On the technical side, Tricky Trials is heralding a new age for data packs with Enchantments, Paintings and Jukebox Music Discs now being data-driven. With this release, we're also going live with performance improvements to chunk loading that were introduced in 24w19a, which reduces memory and CPU overhead compared to the old system.

### Structures

#### Trial Chambers

*   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges
    *   Made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks, and can be found in different sizes
    *   A relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
    *   Natural mob spawning does not occur inside, similar to Ancient Cities
    *   Never starts inside a Deep Dark biome, but can sometimes overlap it
*   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, rewards and a variety of combat areas
    *   Decorated Pots line the corridors and hold hidden treasures
    *   Supply Barrels can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
    *   Vaults are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level Enchanted Books and equipment including a very rare chance to receive a Trident
    *   Ominous Vaults can be found in harder to reach places and give even better loot than standard Vaults, including some items which are exclusive to Ominous Vaults
*   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
    *   Melee
        *   Zombie
        *   Husk
        *   Spider
    *   Small Melee
        *   Slime
        *   Cave Spider
        *   Baby Zombie
        *   Silverfish
    *   Ranged
        *   Skeleton
        *   Stray
        *   Bogged
*   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
    *   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Spiders, Silverfish and Skeletons
    *   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

### Mobs

#### Breeze

*   A cunning hostile mob spawned by some Trial Spawners in Trial Chamber rooms
    *   Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
    *   The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments
*   Moves primarily by leaping around its target
*   Deflects almost all projectiles, making it immune to ranged combat
    *   With one notable exception: it cannot deflect Wind Charges
*   An aggressive adversary, it shoots volatile wind energy in the form of Wind Charge projectiles at its target
    *   After colliding with an entity or a block, Wind Charge projectiles produce a Wind Burst, which knocks back entities in the area
    *   Wind Charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
    *   Wind Charges break decorated pots and chorus flower blocks upon collision
*   Wind Bursts have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
    *   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
    *   Fence Gates are flipped
    *   Buttons are pressed
    *   Levers are flipped
    *   Bells are rung and swung
    *   Lit Candles are extinguished
*   Wind Bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal
*   Will not retaliate against attacks from the following mobs: Skeletons, Strays, Bogged, Zombies, Husks, Spiders, Cave Spiders and Slimes
    *   The same mobs will not retaliate against a Breeze when hurt by its Wind Charge projectile

#### Bogged

*   A new variant of Skeletons that shoots poisonous arrows
    *   They're easier to take down with 16 health instead of 20 health
    *   They attack at a slower interval of 3.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds
*   Has a chance to drop Arrows of Poison when killed by players
*   These mossy and mushroom covered Skeletons spawn naturally in Swamps and Mangrove Swamps
    *   Can also be found spawning from Trial Spawners in some Trial Chambers
*   Drops 2 mushrooms when sheared (either both red, both brown, or one of each)

### Weapons

#### Mace

*   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
    *   Has a base damage of 5
    *   Can be crafted with a Breeze Rod and a Heavy Core
    *   Using it will decrease its durability like any other weapon; can be repaired with Breeze Rods at an Anvil
*   Has a unique attack called the smash attack. When the player falls more than 1.5 blocks before hitting, a smash attack is triggered which has multiple effects:
    *   Safe Fall: Resets all vertical momentum and negates any fall damage accumulated from the fall
    *   Extra Damage: Does more damage the further the player fell before hitting the target with it:
        *   For the first 3 blocks fallen: Add 4 damage per block
        *   For the next 5 blocks fallen: Add 2 damage per block
        *   For any blocks fallen after: Add 1 damage per block
    *   Great Knockback: Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
*   Can be used in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks to enemies
*   These existing enchantments can be applied to the Mace:
    *   Mending
    *   Unbreaking
    *   Smite
    *   Bane of Arthropods
    *   Fire Aspect
    *   Curse of Vanishing
*   The Mace also has 3 exclusive enchantments: Density, Breach and Wind Burst

### Enchantments

Three new enchantments have been added which are exclusive to the Mace

*   Density
    *   Common Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in random loot chests
    *   Has 5 levels
    *   Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level
        *   Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 0.5 per level of Density
    *   Mutually exclusive with Breach, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods
*   Breach
    *   Rare Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in random loot chests
    *   Has 4 levels
    *   Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target
        *   The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level
    *   Mutually exclusive with Density, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods
*   Wind Burst
    *   Unique enchantment which can only be found in Ominous Vaults
        *   Only Wind Burst I can be found, higher levels must be obtained by combining them in an Anvil
    *   Has 3 levels
    *   Maces enchanted with Wind Burst will emit a Wind Burst upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other
    *   Successfully landing a Wind Burst attack causes the player to lose the fall damage protection they would otherwise have from landing a successful smash attack
    *   Each level will bounce the attacker an additional 7 blocks into the air

### Blocks

#### Crafter

*   A new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone
    *   Can be crafted with 5 Iron Ingots, 2 Redstone Dust, 1 Crafting Table and 1 Dropper
*   Will eject one crafting result at a time when powered by a Redstone pulse
    *   Its current powered state is indicated by Redstone crystals on its back face, which will light up
    *   The crafting grid on its top face will light up red when it successfully crafts a recipe
*   Upon receiving a signal, it will eject the recipe result from the front face
    *   If the recipe output has any remainder items (such as a Bucket), the result and remainder items will be ejected together
*   When placed, the front face of the Crafter will face towards the player

##### Crafter User Interface

*   Has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid
*   The crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by interacting with it while not holding an item
*   A slot that is ‘toggled’ cannot hold any items
    *   Other blocks such as Hoppers and Droppers also cannot place items into them
*   Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse, but cannot be manually taken out by the player
    *   The arrow pointing out from the recipe grid will light up red when the Crafter is currently powered
*   The Crafter User Interface is shared between all players interacting with it, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers

##### Crafter Interaction with Other Blocks

*   The signal strength of a Comparator reading a Crafter is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength
*   Hoppers and Minecarts with Hoppers can be used to both insert and extract items from the Crafter
*   Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter
*   Items inserted from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) will fill the Crafter's slots based on these rules:
    *   Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    *   If there are no empty slots then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)
    *   If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container
    *   If the item cannot be moved, it will be ejected into the world
*   Items are removed from Crafters by Hoppers and Minecarts with Hoppers in the same order as from other containers like Chests

#### Trial Spawner

*   A new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon defeat
    *   Cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally throughout Trial Chambers
    *   Very slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
    *   Cannot be moved by Pistons
*   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
    *   The challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
    *   Trial Spawners can only notice players which are in line of sight, and will ignore Creative and Spectator players
*   Unlike normal Spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
    *   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
    *   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
    *   Spawned mobs are persistent
*   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a number of rewards which is proportional to the current challenge level
    *   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes, during which it will no longer spawn mobs
*   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
    *   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
*   Has an Ominous Trial Spawner variant, accessible through an Ominous Trial

#### Vault

*   A block that holds locked treasure and loot - players must find the right key to eject its rewards
    *   Can be found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot
    *   Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked
    *   Cannot be crafted nor obtained in Survival, and does not drop anything when mined
    *   Explosion resistant and cannot be moved by Pistons
*   Can be unlocked by an unlimited number of players
    *   After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot personally unlock that Vault again
    *   If a player has not unlocked a particular Vault before, this can be seen by an orange stream of particles that flow from the player to that Vault when nearby
*   Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby
    *   If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open
    *   If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed
*   Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table
    *   Players cannot time their unlocks to eject the item that is currently displayed in the cage
*   The loot it ejects is randomized each time it is unlocked
*   Has an Ominous Vault variant, unlockable through an Ominous Trial

#### Copper Family

    *   Chiseled Copper
    *   Copper Grate
    *   Copper Bulb
    *   Copper Door

*   Can be crafted in the Stonecutter

##### Copper Grate

*   A new type of decorative block unique to the Copper family
*   Crafted with 4 Copper Blocks of a shared oxidation level
    *   Stonecutting a Copper Block into Copper Grates outputs 4 Copper Grates
*   Properties:
    *   Transparent and allows light to pass through
    *   Mobs cannot suffocate inside them
    *   Cannot conduct Redstone
    *   Hostile mobs cannot naturally spawn on them
    *   Can hold water

##### Copper Bulb

*   A light-emitting block that can toggle its light emission through Redstone pulses
*   Oxidizes like other Copper blocks, and emits light based on oxidation level
    *   Copper Bulb: Light level 15
    *   Exposed Copper Bulb: Light level 12
    *   Weathered Copper Bulb: Light level 8
    *   Oxidized Copper Bulb: Light level 4
*   When placed, its light is off by default
    *   While it is unpowered, it will toggle its light on or off when it receives a Redstone pulse
    *   Its light will stay on even when the Redstone source is removed, and will only toggle off when it receives another Redstone pulse
*   A Redstone crystal can be seen in its center while it is powered by a Redstone signal
*   Similar to Glass Blocks, it does not conduct Redstone power
*   Comparators reading a Copper Bulb will output a signal strength of 15 if the Copper Bulb's light is on
*   The crafting recipe for 4 Copper Bulbs is:
    *   3 Copper Blocks of a shared oxidation level
    *   1 Blaze Rod
    *   1 Redstone Dust

##### Copper Doors and Trapdoors

*   Copper variants of Doors and Trapdoors that can oxidize over time and be waxed
*   Behaves like wooden doors, meaning they can be opened and closed with interaction as well as Redstone

*   Crafted with Copper Ingots

    *   Comes in 5 variations, one for each Bad Omen level
    *   The bottle breaks when consumed
    *   Can be stacked to 64
*   Ominous Bottles can be found uncommonly in any Vaults, and are dropped by Raid Captains which are defeated outside a Raid

#### Wind Charge

*   Become the Breeze! Using this item will fire off a Wind Charge projectile similar to the Breeze's
    *   Can be used to launch entities away from the impact of the Wind Burst
    *   Grants 10% more knockback than a Breeze's, but has a much smaller area of impact
    *   Deals damage if it hits an entity directly
    *   Has a half-second cooldown after each use
    *   Can be fired from a dispenser
*   Players can use Wind Charges to propel themselves high into the air
    *   Players that launch themselves with a Wind Charge only accumulate fall damage below the height of where they collided with the Wind Burst
    *   As an example, if a player uses a Wind Charge to launch themselves 9 blocks into the air, and they do not land lower than where they initially launched, they will take 0 damage

#### Trial Key

### Ominous Events

*   Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in Trial Chambers
*   These optional experiences can be accessed through Bad Omen, and are now known as Ominous Events
    *   They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways
    *   Raids are an example of an existing Ominous Event
*   As a result, Bad Omen has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player
    *   It is no longer given to players that defeat a Raid Captain outside a Raid
    *   Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming the new Ominous Bottle item

#### Raids

*   Bad Omen no longer triggers a Raid directly when entering a Village
    *   Instead, it will transform into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds
    *   Once the Raid Omen expires, a Raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen
    *   Like any other effect, players can drink a Bucket of Milk to clear the Raid Omen, preventing the Raid from starting

#### Ominous Trials

*   A new Ominous Event that can be accessed by exploring a Trial Chamber while Bad Omen is active
*   This event will have players facing more powerful Ominous Trial Spawners, if they dare

##### Trial Omen

*   A variant that Bad Omen can transform into
    *   This occurs when the player is within detection range of a Trial Spawner that is not Ominous
    *   The Trial Omen will have a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level
*   Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles

##### Ominous Trial Spawner

*   A more powerful active phase of the Trial Spawner with unique challenges and rewards
    *   Provides a more challenging experience that combat-loving players can opt into for better rewards
*   If a Trial Spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become Ominous if:
    *   It is not in cooldown
    *   Or, it is in cooldown but was not Ominous during its last activation
        *   Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown
*   While active, it will:
    *   Glow blue instead of orange
    *   Emit soul flames instead of normal flames
    *   Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs
        *   Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn
        *   These projectiles will always include a single type of Lingering Potion from a set of possible effects
*   The mobs it spawns are more powerful than usual:
    *   Mobs that can wear equipment will often spawn with enchanted weapons and armor
        *   The armor these mobs wear have Armor Trims applied from the Trial Chambers
        *   All 3 of the following armor enchantments are applied to each piece:
            *   Protection IV
            *   Projectile Protection IV
            *   Fire Protection IV
        *   Sword enchantments can be either of the two:
            *   Sharpness I
            *   Knockback I
        *   Bow enchantments can be either of the two:
            *   Power I
            *   Punch I
    *   Mobs that cannot wear equipment will instead be spawned at double the total mob count over the course of the challenge
        *   The spawners for these mobs will also have an additional mob out at once during its challenge
*   Becoming Ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
    *   If those mobs picked up or equipped any items on the floor, those items will be dropped when they despawn
    *   It will stay Ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished
*   When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot to normal Trial Spawners

##### Ominous Vault

*   A variant of Vaults that have a more menacing looking and emit soul flames instead of normal flames
*   These hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard Vaults that are unlocked by Trial Keys
*   Can be found throughout Trial Chambers in harder to reach places, and require an Ominous Trial Key to unlock

##### Ominous Trial Key

*   A variant of the Trial Key which has a 30% chance to eject when defeating an Ominous Trial Spawner
*   Can be used to unlock Ominous Vaults

### Status Effects

    *   Splash Potions, Lingering Potions and Tipped Arrows can be made with these effects
*   These effects can be encountered while taking on an Ominous Trial Spawner
*   Some mobs are immune to these effects
    *   Slimes are immune to Oozing
    *   Silverfish are immune to Infested
*   Whenever a mob with Oozing dies, it will check within a 5x5x5 area how many Slimes there are
    *   If the amount exceeds the max entity cramming cap (24 by default), it will not spawn any Slimes
    *   If it does not exceed it, it will attempt to spawn 2 Slimes up until the max entity cramming cap

### Enchantments

Enchantments are now set through data. An Enchantment is a set of core properties like level ranges and cost together with some effects. Most effect types also support a set of conditions, making it possible to apply them only when certain criteria are met.

Enchantments can be added in the registry enchantment. All Vanilla Enchantments can be found in the vanilla datapack in the client and server jar files.

Fields:

*   description: The name of the Enchantment when displayed in text represented as a Text Component

#### Level-Based Values

Many effects of Enchantments depend on the level of the Enchantment. For these fields, a type called Level-Based Values is used. In their most basic form, Level-Based Values can be written as floating-point constants, which is interpreted as a value that isn't in fact level-based, the constant is used as-is for all levels.

If a Level-Based value is not a floating-point constant, it is an object with a type field, specifying one of the following types.

##### linear

The most common type of Level-Based Value is a linear value. A linear Level-Based Value has two fields:

*   base: The base value added to all levels
*   per\_level\_above\_first: Amount added for each level above the first one

In effect, a linear Level-Based Value results in base + per\_level\_above\_first \* (level - 1).

##### clamped

A Level-Based Value type that clamps a value between a min and max. Fields:

*   value: A Level-Based Value used as the input
*   min: A floating point value specifying the minimum value of the output
*   max: A floating point value specifying the maximum value of the output

*   numerator: A Level-Based Value used as the numerator
*   denominator: A Level-Based Value used as the denominator

##### levels\_squared

A Level-Based Value type that evaluates to the square of the levels, plus an addition. Fields:

*   added: A floating-point value added to the result of the squared levels

In effect, a levels\_squared Level-Based Value results in level ^ 2 + added

##### lookup

A Level-Based Value type that maps a list of values to specific levels, and applies a fallback if the level is greater than the number of values supplied. Fields:

*   values - A list of values indexed by level - 1 to apply, if present

#### Attribute Effects

Attribute effects use the Attribute system to apply an Attribute Modifier whenever the Enchanted Item is correctly equipped. Attribute effects do not have a dynamic type - they are all the same type.

Fields:

*   id: The namespaced ID of the Attribute Modifier to add
    *   This will be postfixed with the slot name when the enchanted item is equipped in a slot
    *   Must be unique to avoid different Enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others
*   attribute: The ID of the attribute to modify
*   operation: The operation of the Attribute Modifier
    *   One of add\_value, add\_multiplied\_base and add\_multiplied\_total
*   amount: A Level-Based Value describing the amount

#### Entity Effect Types

Entity Effects are Enchantment effects that generally do something to an Entity involved in an event. Which entity is affected depends on the specific component being configured.

#### Location-Based Effect Types

Location-Based Effects are special effects that activate and deactivate depending on where the owner of the Enchanted Item moves. Location-Based Effect only trigger when such items are initially equipped and subsequently when the owning entity moves to a new space in the Block grid - i.e. when their coordinates change to a new integer value.

All Entity Effect types can also be used as Location-Based Effects, and in addition attribute can be used to specify an Attribute Effect as a location-based effect.

#### Effect Conditions

Most Enchantment effects are filtered using Conditions (same types as in loot tables). This enables effects to be specific for different situations. Each Effect Component defines which parameters are available for the condition to evaluate - some parameters are available for all of these parameter sets, while some are specific to a certain set.

Unlike with loot tables, all effect conditions need to be inline objects and cannot be references.

Each effect component specifies which parameters are available in the [Effect Components](#effect-components) list below.

*   Enchantment Level
*   Origin
*   Damage Source

#### Effect Components

The effects field in an Enchantment is a map of Effect Component type the Effect List data. Most Effect Components are lists, so any number of Effects can be added of any Component Type. The data for each effect generally involves having a specified condition context and Effect Type, but some Effects also deviate from this format.

In cases where the documentation specifies a Condition Context and Effect, the Component is a list. Each entry in the list has a field named effect with the effect of the type used by the list. Entries can also optionally include a field named requirements specifying the condition parameters, which are then evaluated with the documented context.

These Enchantment Providers are only used when the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment is enabled and all have the following pattern:

trades/<biome>\_<profession>\_<equipment>\_<level>

For example: trades/desert\_armorer\_helmet\_4 and trades/taiga\_armorer\_chestplate\_5.

#### Enchantment Provider Types

##### single\_enchantment

An Enchantment Provider which always provides the same Enchantment. The level of the Enchantment can be either constant or randomized.

Fields:

*   enchantment: Namespaced ID of the Enchantment
*   level: Int provider representing the level of the Enchantment

##### enchantments\_by\_cost

An Enchantment Provider which gives one or more Enchantments from a set of options according to a given cost (similar to the cost value in the Enchantment Table).

Fields:

*   enchantments: The set of Enchantments as either a single Enchantment, a list of Enchantments or hash-prefixed Enchantment Tag
*   cost: Int provider representing the cost to use for the Enchanting process

##### enchantments\_by\_cost\_with\_difficulty

An Enchantment Provider which works like enchantments\_by\_cost, but where the cost is calculated partially based on the local difficulty of the area where the event happens causing the Enchantments to be added.

The used cost is a minimum cost plus a uniformly randomized factor up to a base cost span multiplied with the special factor, which starts at 0 for local difficulty up to 2, increases linearly up to 1 for local difficulty 4 and stays at a constant value of 1 for any difficulty above that.

Fields:

*   enchantments: The set of Enchantments as either a single Enchantment, a list of Enchantments or hash-prefixed Enchantment Tag
